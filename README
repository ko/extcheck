# What it does
In each subdirectory, create a ".cksum" file. Contents are CSV
format as following:

> file_name,checksum

When verifying and a mismatch is found, the following tuple
is returned (and printed, as of 2013-12-27):

> file_name,checksum_in_table,checksum_just_calculated

The list of this tuple is written to disk for future reference.

# Future TODO
Multiple arguments allowed?
* No
** Not sensible (--verify --resetdb --list) 
** Order matters? (--resetdb --verify vs. --verify --resetdb)
* Yes
** Saves time? (--resetdb --verify)

Add dedup?
