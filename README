# What it does
In each subdirectory, create a ".cksum" file. Contents are CSV
format as following:

> file_name,checksum

When verifying and a mismatch is found, the following tuple
is returned (and printed, as of 2013-12-27):

> file_name,checksum_in_table,checksum_just_calculated

Save these to a local file at some later date.

# Future TODO
Multiple arguments allowed?
* No
** Not sensible (--verify --resetdb --list) 
** Order matters? (--resetdb --verify vs. --verify --resetdb)
* Yes
** Saves time? (--resetdb --verify)

Write/append (file,cksum1,cksum2) tuple to current (calling) directory
